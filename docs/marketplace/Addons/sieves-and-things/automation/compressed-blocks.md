Since we can generate huge amounts of blocks, we need a way to store them. Thatâ€™s where Compressed Blocks come into play.

**How to Craft:**

1. Take 9 of any compressible block (e.g., Cobblestone).
2. Place all 9 blocks in a Crafting Table.
3. Take the Compressed version.

**Compressible Blocks:**

* Clay
* Cobblestone
* Stone
* Dirt
* Dust
* Endstone
* Gravel
* Sand
* Red Sand
* Netherrack
* Soul Sand
* Soul Soil

*You can also compress Compressed Blocks to make Double Compressed and even Triple Compressed versions.*

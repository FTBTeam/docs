Leaf Worms are versatile little creatures; not only do they help create new materials, but they are also a great source of food!

**How to Use:**
1. With a Leaf Worm in hand, interact with any type of leaves. It will instantly turn into a Dead Leaf.
2. Wait a while, and the surrounding leaves will also be converted into Dead Leaves.
3. After the leaves are converted, break Dead Leaves with a [crook](Tools/crooks.md) to get String.

**How to Eat:**
- Leaf Worms can be cooked in a furnace to make them edible.
- Alternatively, you can craft 1 Sugar and a Leaf Worm to make a Gummy Worm.

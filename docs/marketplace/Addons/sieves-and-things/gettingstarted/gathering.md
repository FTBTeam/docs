The first and easiest step in gathering materials is collecting rocks!

**How to:**
1. Find a patch of Grass or Dirt.
2. Sneak and punch the patch of Grass with an empty hand.
3. Collect your Rocks.

There are four types of Rocks: Stone, Andesite, Diorite, and Granite.

If you combine 4 of them together, you can make the corresponding blocks: Cobblestone, Andesite, Diorite, and Granite Blocks.

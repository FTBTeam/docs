Sieves are the most important blocks for resource gathering. With a Sieve, you can refine many blocks into new and different materials.

Click the button below to find out which blocks are *sievable* and what they drop.

**How to Use:**
1. Place down any Sieve.
2. Add any Mesh to the Sieve.
3. Insert a *sievable* block like Dirt or Gravel.
4. Keep interacting with the Sieve until the block disappears.
5. Pick up the loot, and repeat.

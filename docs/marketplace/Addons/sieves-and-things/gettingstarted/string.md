In **Sieves & Things**, there’s an alternate way of obtaining String… the Leaf Worm!

**How to Obtain:**
1. With a Leaf Worm in hand, interact with any type of leaves. It will instantly turn into a Dead Leaf.
2. Wait a while, and the surrounding leaves will also be converted into Dead Leaves.
3. After the leaves are converted, break Dead Leaves to get String.

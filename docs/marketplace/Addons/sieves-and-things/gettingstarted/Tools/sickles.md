## Sickle

The Sickle is a great farming tool to harvest multiple crops at once.

There are 6 Sickles: Wood, Stone, Iron, Gold, Diamond, and Netheriteâ€”each one more durable and quicker than the last.

**Usage:**
- Breaking Leaves and foliage with a Sickle will result in other similar blocks being removed at the same time (within a 5-block radius).
- Interacting with crops will harvest them and any other ready crop near it (within a 5-block radius). This will also replant the crops; however, it doesn't work on Pumpkins and Melons.

*Can also be enchanted similar to a Hoe.*

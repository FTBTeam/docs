## Hammer

The Hammer is a new tool that lets players break down blocks into different ones.

There are 6 Hammers: Wood, Stone, Iron, Gold, Diamond, and Netheriteâ€”each one more durable and quicker than the last.

For example, if you break Dirt with the Hammer, it will convert into Sand. Below is a full list of block conversions:

**Hammer Conversions:**
- Cobble -> Gravel
- Gravel -> Dirt
- Dirt -> Sand
- Sandstone -> Sand
- Sand -> Dust
- Red Sand -> Dust
- Red Sandstone -> Red Sand
- Netherrack -> Crushed Netherrack
- Basalt -> Crushed Basalt
- Endstone -> Crushed Endstone
- Stone, Granite, Diorite & Andesite -> Gravel

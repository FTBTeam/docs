#### Seared Faucet

![Seared Faucet Recipe](../../_assets/images/tinkers-seared_faucet_recipe.png)

For quick and direct pouring of molten liquid into Casting Tables and Basins, Seared Faucets are significantly faster than using cans.

Provided the liquid doesn't need to be moved or stored.

How to use:
1. Place a Faucet on the side of a Melter or Seared Drain.
2. Place either a Casting Table or Basin below it.
3. Interact with the Faucet to pour it out.

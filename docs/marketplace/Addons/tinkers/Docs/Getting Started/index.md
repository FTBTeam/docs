### Blank Patterns

In Tinkers' Construct, you'll rely on patterns extensively. 

These patterns are used to shape both the individual tool parts and the worktables you'll need for crafting.

### Stencil Table

The first step in your Tinkering adventure is to create a Stencil Table.

You'll need Blank Patterns for this, which you can craft from Planks.

*For Weapons like Swords or Cleavers, you will need a Tinkers' Anvil.*

### Tin Ore

Tinkers' Construct 3.0 introduces Tin as a new material. Tin One can be found deep underground, typically in the same layers where Copper One generates.

While Tin has a few uses, its primary purpose is to be combined with Copper to create the Bronze alloy.

Other uses include crafting Tin Cans and decorative Tin Blocks.

Tin comes in several forms: Raw Tin, Tin Nuggets, Tin Ingots, Tin Blocks, and Raw Tin Blocks.

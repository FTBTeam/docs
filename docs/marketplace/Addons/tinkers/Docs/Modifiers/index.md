Modifiers grant unique abilities to your tools and weapons, though strangely, they don't seem to work with any throwable items.

### Modifier Template

The first step is to learn how to create a Modifier Template. Think of this as the foundation for all your future Modifiers.

## Crafting modifiers

To create any Modifier, we always start with a Modifier Template and surround it with the required materials.

For example, to make an Explosive Modifier, we'll infuse the Template with TNT and Gunpowder.

*All recipes can be crafted at a Crafting Table.

All Modifiers will be displayed in the in-game crafting menu for easy access.

Simply search for 'Modifier' or use a Modifier Template to view available options.

You can combine a variety of Modifiers to create epic Tools and Weapons.

Keep in mind that Modifiers are exclusive to Tinkers' Construct items.

They won't work with Vanilla Minecraft items or items from other mods, and they can't be applied to Slings, Throwables, or Bows.

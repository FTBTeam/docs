<details>
    <summary>Extra Info & Known Issues</summary>
    Storage Limits: While storage drawers are great for bulk storage, there are a few exceptions.

    Items that can only stack to 1, like armor, tools, and weapons, won't fit in these drawers.

    Breaking Safely: To avoid losing items, make sure the drawer is completely empty first.

    Known issues: Occasionally, blocks may display the incorrect texture when placed.

    Rest assured, the block type remains unchanged; this is a visual issue only.

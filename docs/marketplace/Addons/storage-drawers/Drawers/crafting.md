### Half Drawer

Storage Drawers also have half block variants.

To create a half block version, simply pop any Storage Drawer into a Stonecutter.

### Double Drawers

Need to store more items in a compact space? Double Drawers are the solution.

These drawers function like regular Drawers but have two compartments, each capable of holding up to 16 stacks of an item(without upgrades)

**They can also be placed in a Stonecutter to make half block versions.**

### Compacting Drawer

The Compacting Drawer is a special storage block that automatically converts items between their compacted and original forms.

Itâ€™s perfect for managing resources like iron, gold, and more.

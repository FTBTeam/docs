# Why are some versions missing

You might be looking at the versions of the mods we're offering documentation for and noticing that we've grouped multiple Minecraft versions and in some instances not listed some versions we have mods for. There are many reasons behind this and we've tried to explain them below.

## But why?

### Missing versions

In some cases, we've missed older Minecraft versions in our document purely due to the fact that those mods are on LTS (Long Time Support) and we recommend moving onto our newer mods. We will continue to fix these versions but putting significant amount of time into documenting mods that are no longer being actively developed is a poor usage of our time. If you want to contribute to our documentation, we'd greatly appreciate your time and contributions!

### Minecraft version ranges

We're using Minecraft version ranges when ever our mods haven't changed in any significant way between the versions. Our documentation here is designed more of a rough guide than it is a definitive reference for all things FTB Mods. Our mods cover a lot of bases and documenting it all would be extremely time consuming. Like with the above, if you would like to contribute extra tips and tricks to our guides, we'd happily review and accept them into our documentation.

## Quick fire round

::: details I can't find documentation for X mod
In some instances, we make mods designed as `One time use` mods. This means that our documentation for that mod will be located in its source code (found on our [Github](https://go.ftb.team/github)) or the Repositories `README.md`.

It's also possible we just haven't got there yet. If you think this may be the case, please request it on our Github Repo (You can find a link in the top right of the page). 
:::

::: details The documentation in X file is wrong
If the documentation is wrong for the version range stated, and we do not have a version of the documentation for the game version specified. Please suggest changes, you can find the `suggest changes` button at the bottom of each page.

If the documentation is correct but is incorrect for a specific Minecraft version in the version range, then please let us know and we can add a footnote with the correct information for that specific version.
:::

::: details What is a version range
What we mean by a version range is when we use the schema of `1.16-1.19`. What this means is any mods within the game range of `1.16` to `1.19` so this would include `1.17` and `1.18`.
:::

::: details Can I add more versions to the documentation
Yes! With exceptions. We won't accept documentation contributed that only covers part of a mod. Either it covers everything or it isn't included. There is only one thing more annoying than no documentation and that's partial documentation.

## What is FTB XMod Compat?

FTB XMod Compat is a compatibility mod that is designed to provide compatibility between FTB Mods and other mods. We used to have all the cross mod (xmod btw) compatibility code in each of our mods but this was quickly becoming a maintence nightmare. So we decided to move all of the compatibility code into a single mod. This allows us to keep all of the compatibility code in one place and makes it easier to maintain and update.

## Features

The features of XMod compat differ from mod to mod but they generally include:

- KubeJS support (Events, extension points)
- JEI/EMI/REI Support
- And many more...

It's not simple to list all the features of XMod compat as it's a compatibility mod and the features are generally specific to the mods that it's providing compatibility for. This list is also constantly changing due mods updating, becoming unsupported, etc.

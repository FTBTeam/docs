So something went wrong and you need to restore a backup? No problem! FTB Backups 3 makes it easy to restore your world.

    <TabItem value="singleplayer" label="Singleplayer" default>
        If you are playing in singleplayer, you can restore a backup by using the in-game menu and following these steps:

        1. Go to the Singleplayer menu
        2. Click on the `Restore World...` button in the top right corner next to the world search bar
        3. Select the backup you want to restore from the list
        4. Click the `Restore` button

        Now you can load your world and continue playing as if nothing happened!
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="multiplayer" label="Multiplayer">
        On a server you will need to manually restore a backup by following these steps:

        1. Stop the server if it's running
        2. Rename the current world folder to something else (e.g. `world_old`)
        3. Navigate to the `ftbbackups3` folder in your server directory
            - This folder may be different if you have configured a custom backup folder in the `ftbbackups3-server.snbt` config file
        4. Extract the backup you want to restore, the backup files are named by the date and time they were created, so you can easily find the one you want `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS`
        5. Copy the extracted world folder into the server directory and rename it to `world` (or whatever your server is configured to use)
        6. Start the server again

        Now you can join the server and continue playing as if nothing happened!

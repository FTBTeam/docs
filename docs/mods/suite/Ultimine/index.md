## What is Ultimine?

FTB Ultimine is our take on a vein miner like mod. It allows you to mine blocks in a variety of different ways by holding a key whilst mining. 

- `Efficient Block Harvesting`: Hold the configurable Tilde/Grave key to harvest multiple blocks simultaneously, streamlining your mining process.
- `Enhanced Visuals (1.15+)`: Experience improved visual cues with white lines around blocks slated for mining, harvesting or hoeing, gain an insight to what you're doing. No more accidents!
- `Hoe Usage for Grass`: Extend the functionality to farming by using a hoe on grass in a similar manner to till multiple blocks at once, saving you time and effort.
- `Crop Harvesting`: Simplify the harvesting of crops by right-clicking on them, offering a convenient way to gather resources effortlessly.
- `Special Handling for Grass`: Take advantage of unique handling for grass, which effectively manages grass-like blocks positioned beyond the standard 1-block range.
- `Mining Assist`: With ultimine you can also dig tunnels with ease, from a staircase up or down, to your next mineshaft!

FTB Quests has a number of integrations with other mods. These integrations allow you to use the features of other mods in your quests.

WIP
:::

FTB Filter system but that’s a mod that needs it’s own docs anyway. Basically, complex filters that allows authors to configure item checks via a GUI

JEI, REI: Works with lib as well and shows a dedicated page on the item selection for JEI items, it also adds quest items as a reward section in the uses / recipe tabs, it might do more, not sure.

KubeJS: Events and custom quest types as well as custom filters

Not sure if there is anything else par from those


Explain how to make tag based quests using FTB filters and xmod compat, e.g Logs
tl;dr create a Logs item quest, right click on the quest and convert it to a tag quest

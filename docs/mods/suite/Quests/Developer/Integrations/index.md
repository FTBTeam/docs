FTB Quests has a number of integrations with other mods. These integrations allow you to use the features of other mods in your quests.

WIP
:::

FTB Filter system but that’s a mod that needs it’s own docs anyway. Basically, complex filters that allows authors to configure item checks via a GUI

JEI, REI: Works with lib as well and shows a dedicated page on the item selection for JEI items, it also adds quest items as a reward section in the uses / recipe tabs, if a reward contains a loot create it will also show what items can drop from it

KubeJS: Events and custom quest types as well as custom filters


Explain how to make tag based quests using FTB filters and xmod compat, e.g Logs
tl;dr create a Logs item quest, right click on the quest and convert it to a tag quest

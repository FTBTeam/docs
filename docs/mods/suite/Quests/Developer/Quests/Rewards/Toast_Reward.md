# Toast Reward

A toast reward displays a pop-up for the player. The only use is for information.

## Use case example

Let's say you create a quest and edit it.

![Editing a quest](../../../../../_assets/images/quests/rewards/toast-edit-quest.webp "Right-click the icon to edit the quest")

You then disable the pop-up by setting "Disable Toast Completion" to `True`.

Optionally, set a title. In this example we choose "Gather Iron Ingots".

![Disabling the pop-up](../../../../../_assets/images/quests/rewards/toast-disable-popup.png "Disabling the toast completion pop-up")

Hit "Accept".

![The accept button](../../../../../_assets/images/quests/rewards/accept.png "Hitting the accept button ensures saving your changes!")

After your changes, open the quest and add the toast reward (the sign icon) and a diamond.

![Example toast quest](../../../../../_assets/images/quests/rewards/toast-example-quest.png "A sample toast quest")

Now edit the toast reward.

![Editing the toast](../../../../../_assets/images/quests/rewards/toast-edit-reward.webp "Right-click the icon to edit the toast reward")

We enable "Auto-claim".

We set the description to "You can claim a diamond!"

We set the title of the toast reward to the title of the quest: "Gather Iron Ingots".

![Editing the title and description](../../../../../_assets/images/quests/rewards/toast-edit-title-desc.png "Edit the title and description with some custom text")

Hit "Accept".

![The accept button](../../../../../_assets/images/quests/rewards/accept.png "Hitting the accept button ensures saving your changes!")

Now, when a player completes the quest, the toast appears in the upper-right corner of the screen.

![Toast appears](../../../../../_assets/images/quests/rewards/toast-show-up.webp "The toast appears!")

Toast rewards are therefore an effective way to convey specific information to players.

## Auto-pinning quests

You can tell FTB Quests to automatically pin quests, so they are always visible. To accomplish this, open the quest book and click the pin icon in the top right of the screen.
This will pin all the quests in the quest book, in large modpacks this may cause the list of quests to go off the screen.

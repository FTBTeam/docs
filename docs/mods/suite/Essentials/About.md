## What is FTB Essentials?

FTB Essentials is a server-side mod which adds a large collection of useful and convenient commands, both for players and server admins.

All commands can be individually disabled in the [mod configuration](/docs/mods/suite/Essentials/Configuration), and the [FTB Ranks mod](/docs/mods/suite/Essentials/Ranks_Integration) can optionally be used for more fine-grained access to commands and features.

title: Durations

Durations are used in a number of places in FTB Essentials, such as muting players, and are a shorthand way of specifying a time period.

- `1s` - 1 second
- `1m` - 1 minute
- `1h` - 1 hour
- `1d` - 1 day
- `1w` - 1 week
- `*` - Forever

## Examples

`/mute Slowpoke101 2h` would mute the player `Slowpoke101` for `2 hours`

## Versioning

Due to the nature of how Minecraft updates work, we're put into a position where our mods will occasionally be different in various ways on one Minecraft version vs another Minecraft version.

What this means is that we have had to find a careful balance between ensuring documentation is up-to-date as well as ensuring we try and cover variations between different Minecraft versions.

With this in mind, keep an eye out for any version specific information as we'll try and highlight any of note within the normal documentation.

### Major changes in mod versions

In the case that any of our Minecraft mods change in a way that completely changes it's functionality or the way it's interacted with. We'll likely archive the old documentation and provide a reference to it in the new documentation.

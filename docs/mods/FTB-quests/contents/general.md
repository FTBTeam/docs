# Generalities on the contents of FTB Quests

FTB Quests offers different content for using the software and developing with it.

Developing with FTB Quests usually means to create quests for a modpack, which then players can try to complete in a playthrough of the final product.

Players can first read how to use the questbook for playing (section: [users](./users/questbook-usage.md)). Developers need to understand how the questing environment works at first (section: [developers](./developers/environment-setup.md)).

## Commands

Both audiences will have commands available to them in-game to help them with FTB Quests. These commands will also be linked in the [users](./users/questbook-usage.md) or [developers](./developers/environment-setup.md) sections mentioned above respectably, when pertinent, so you will come back here once in a while.

Commands are available to view by expanding the "commands" subsection on the sidebar.

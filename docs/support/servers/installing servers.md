# Installing a Feed the Beast Server

So you've downloaded your modpack on the *FTB App*, played around and decided to create a server for you and your friends. Well this guide is all about helping you do that! This will use the **Server Installer**, which will help you download the modpack and all its dependencies such as *Forge*.

First, you'll need to get the **Server Installer** either on the Feed the Beast website or from inside your *FTB App*.

::: tip
To get it on the *FTB App*, head to the modpack page and click the Versions tab. The server files will be listed on a button. Skip ahead a few steps if you choose this.
:::

To get it on the site, view and choose the modpack you want to install a server for. For this example, we'll be installing FTB University 1.16, but it works exactly the same for other modpacks or versions.

Open [**https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpack**](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpack) and click the title of the modpack.

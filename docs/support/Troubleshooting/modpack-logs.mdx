# Find Instance Logs

:::tip Terminology
The word `Instance` is typically used to relate to a Modpack that you have installed on the FTB App or CurseForge App.
:::

The FTB App and CurseForge App make finding modpack logs extremely easy. You can find the instance logs by following the guide below, just click on the tab for the app you are using.

## Opening the modpack folder

Select the tab for the app you are using, then follow the steps below on how to open the modpack folder.

<Tabs queryString="app">
    <TabItem value="ftb-app" label="FTB App">
        1. Open the FTB App
        2. Go to your modpack library
        3. Right click on the modpack you want to get the logs from
        4. Click on the option named `Open Folder`
            - Optionally you can also open the logs folder directly by hovering over the `Open folder` option and then click on `Logs`
        5. This will now open your file browser to where the modpack is installed and you can follow the steps below
    </TabItem>

        2. Go to `My Modpacks`
        3. Right click on the modpack you want to get the logs from
        4. Click on the option named `Open Folder`
        5. This will now open your file browser to where the modpack is installed and you can follow the steps below

    <TabItem value="multimc-prism" label="MultiMC / Prism Launcher">
        1. Open MultiMC or Prism Launcher
        2. Right click on the modpack you want to get the logs from
        3. Click on the option named `Folder`
        4. This will now open your file browser to where the launcher stores the files for that instance
        5. Open the `minecraft` folder then follow the steps below
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now that we have opened the modpack folder, we can find the logs that we need.
Depending on the reason you are looking for logs, you may need to look in different folders.

## Normal game logs
Normal game logs are located in the `logs` folder, these are the logs that are useful to debug certain issues where something may not be behaving correctly.
These logs are typically named `latest.log` and contain the most recent log from the game. If you are looking for a specific log, you can also look for files named `debug.log` or `fml-client-latest.log`, these logs contain more detailed information about the game and can be useful for debugging.

## Crash-reports
Ohhh no! The game crashed! Don't worry, we can find the crash report by looking in the `crash-reports` folder. This folder contains all the crash reports that have been generated by the game.
These are ordered by date, you will want to locate the file with the titled date that is nearest to when your crash happened.

## What do I do with these files

We recommend that you upload the logs to a pastebin service, you can also directly by drag and drop the log file(s) that has been requested to either Discord/GitHub/whatever platform you are requesting help from, we wouldn't recommend this as the log may be removed if we cant be sure the contents of the file is safe.

### Upload

Upload the files to any typical log sharing website. We've listed our preferred ones below.

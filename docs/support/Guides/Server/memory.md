:::caution
If you are using a hosting company such as BisectHosting you may not be able to change the amount of memory allocated to you using this method, you will need to contact your hosting provider for more information.

## How to change the amount of memory allocated to your server

To increase the memory allocated to your server, you will need to edit the `run.(sh|bat)` file.
You can open the `run.(sh|bat)` file with any text editor, such as Notepad or Notepad++.

:::tip
This is an example of what the last line in the `run.(sh|bat)` file looks like, the last line may look different to you, but it will always have the `-Xmx8192M` and `-Xms6144M` flags.
:::
Once you have the file open, you will want to scroll down to the very bottom line of the file where you will see something like this:
```sh
"jre/jdk-17.0.11+9-jre/Contents/Home/bin/java" -javaagent:log4jfix/Log4jPatcher-1.0.0.jar -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -Xmx8192M -Xms6144M @user_jvm_args.txt @libraries/net/neoforged/neoforge/20.4.237/unix_args.txt nogui
```

Don't worry, you don't need to understand what all of this means, you just need to know that the `-Xmx8192M` is the maximum amount of memory allocated to the server and the `-Xms6144M` is the initial amount of memory allocated to the server.

:::tip
You can use `M` for megabytes and `G` for gigabytes. For example, `-Xmx8192M` and `-Xmx8G` are the same.
:::

So to change the amount of memory allocated to the server, you will need to change the `-Xmx8192M` to the amount of memory you want to allocate to the server, if you are lowering the amount of memory allocated to the server, you will need to change both the `-Xmx8192M` and `-Xms6144M`

For example, if you want to allocate 4GB of memory to the server, you will need to change the `-Xmx8192M` to `-Xmx4096M` and the `-Xms6144M` to `-Xms4096M` or if you want to increase the amount of memory allocated to the server to 16GB, you will need to change the `-Xmx8192M` to `-Xmx16384M`

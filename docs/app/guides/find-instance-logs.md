# Find Instance Logs

::: tip Terminology
The word `Instance` is typically used to relate to a Modpack that you have installed to the FTB App 
:::

The FTB App makes finding Instance logs extremely easy by providing quick links to all the main game folders right next to the play button. You can find the instance logs by following the guide below.

## Locating normal game logs

1. Open the FTB App 
2. Go to the Instance you want to find game logs from
3. Click on the three dots next to the play button
4. Select the option titled `Open`
5. Then select the option titled `Logs Folder`
   - If you do not see the `Logs Folder` option, this means your game doesn't have any logs.
6. The two files of interest in this folder are
    - `debug.log`
    - `latest.log`

## Locating crashlogs

Follow the above steps but before clicking on `Logs Folder` select `Crash Logs Folder`. 

Crashlogs are ordered by date, you will want to locate the file with the titled date that is nearest to when your crash happened.

## What do I do with these files

Please do not drag and drop these into our Discord! We will typically remove them as we can't be sure the contents of the file is safe.

Soooo, it looks like we broke something. Don't worry, we can fix it!

It looks like we released a new version of a modpack that didn't clean up after itself properly. This can happen when a modpack is updated and the old files are not removed correctly.

### How do I fix this?

1. **Close the modpack**: Make sure the modpack is closed before proceeding.
2. **Open the modpack install folder**: You can do this by right-clicking the modpack in the app and clicking "Open Folder".
3. **Now open the `kubejs` folder**: This folder is located inside the modpack install folder.
4. **Then open the `data` folder**: This folder is located inside the `kubejs` folder.
5. **Delete all folders apart from any zip files**: You can do this by selecting all folders and pressing the delete key on your keyboard. Make sure to **not** delete any zip files, as these are needed for the modpack to work.
6. **Restart the modpack**: You can do this by clicking the "Play" button in the app.

FTB Essentials adds several commands with configurable warmup and cooldown delays; these delays can be overridden with FTB Ranks permission nodes.

See [the Essentials documentation page](/mod-docs/mods/suite/Essentials/Ranks_Integration#warmups-and-cooldowns) for more details.

Note that FTB Essentials / FTB Ranks integration does not require FTB XMod Compat to be present.
